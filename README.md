# RhythmNet-TT
 The code implements RhythmNet-TT, a Titan-inspired (Transformer with test-time learning) architecture for ECG arrhythmia detection.  It improves upon ECG-DETR by adding a memory module (MAC-inspired) to handle ECG signal variability and longer sequences.  The code includes the modified Transformer, training, and evaluation components.
